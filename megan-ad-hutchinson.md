What is Git?

This is a version control hub, for application code, used by software developers to maintain and collaborate on projects. (Personal definition)

Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. (https://www.nobledesktop.com/blog/what-is-git-and-why-should-you-use-it)
